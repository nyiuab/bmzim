# bmzim: Bayesian models and zero-inflated models, with applications to microbiome data analysis

# Overview

This package provides functions for setting up and fitting various Bayesian models and zero-inflated models (negative binomial, Gaussian, Studen-t, and beta models), for numerically and graphically summarizing the fitted models, and for evaluating the predictive performance.These Bayesian models are fitted by using fast quasi-Newton algorithm for estimating posterior modes rather than MCMC. The methods can jointly analyze numerous and correlated predictors.
